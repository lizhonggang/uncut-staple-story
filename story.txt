Sam wanted to dunk on people but he could. so he trained and eventually could on the courts. 

"Okay," said Sam, "Now that I've got dunking down, its time to work on the 3 point shot."
Sam practiced and practiced every day, but he could never quite make the shot.
"There has to be something that I'm missing!" he murmured to no one in particular.

Sam decided he needed to take a break. He jogged off the court and decided to check out Instagram.
He looked  up the NBA, and Chris Pauls' profile to give himself some inspiratation and to 
take some notes. 
Sam first noticed the necessary form for a three point shot. He wrote down, "arm must be 90 degrees, 
push up using forearm, and follow through into the cookie jar". 
"Okay" said Sam, "I think I have this down".
